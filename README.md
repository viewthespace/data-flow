# Running

Clone this repo. If you have Ruby installed, you can simply run `./serve` at the repo root, and the app will be served on port 8000 (visit localhost:8000 in your browser). If not, you can use [this list of static server one-liners](https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255) to serve the app in the way that makes you happiest :)
